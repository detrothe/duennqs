	</h1>
	<p>
		With this web application, cross-section values and stresses of thin-walled cross-sections can be calculated.
		The centerline model (wire model) is applied and the finite element method is used for the solution [1], [2],
		[3].
		The cross-section is described similarly to a beam or truss by several straight elements connected by nodes. The
		theory requires that each element must have at least one connection to another element. Thus, no elements may be
		"alone" in the cross section. This means that there must be a path from each element to all other elements.

		The node coordinates are entered in a ȳ-z̄ auxiliary coordinate system whose origin can be selected as desired.
		The elements have a start and end node and can accurately represent quadratic shear stress curves. Therefore, no
		refinement is required. The direction of the shear stresses is indicated by arrows in the quarter points of the
		elements on the right and left sides. If you look mentally from the element start to the element end, the right
		side of the element is at the right hand.

		Since the elements may have different material properties, reference values must be specified. These must also
		be used as material data in a member program if the calculated ideal cross-section values are used for a member
		cross-section.

		The normal stresses due to N, My and Mz are calculated with the usual formulas of mechanics assuming that the
		cross-sections remain plane according to Bernoulli.

		The shear stresses are positive if they act in the direction of the local coordinate system of the element. The
		positive local direction points from the initial to the final node of the element.

	</p>
	<p>
		Features of the program:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The cross section can be asymmetrical, open and/or closed </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Linear elastic material

		<li>
			<p>
				The width of the elements is constant element by element
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				Each element has its own material properties
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				Calculation of all cross-section values
			</p>
		<li>

	<p>The decimal separator is the comma or the point. A thousands separator is not permitted.

		In order to speed up the node and element input, individual cell values or rows of the tables can be copied or
		generated. A block can be selected by pressing the left mouse button. After releasing the mouse button a context
		menu appears.
		For touch screens: When entering with the finger or pen, the selection mode must first be activated by clicking
		the checkbox above a table. When crossing over with the finger or the pen, the selected cells are then
		highlighted in color, as with the mouse. After lifting the finger/pen the context menu appears. No values can be
		entered during the selection mode.

	<ul>
		<li><b>copy first cell value:</b> The value of the first selected cell is copied to the other selected cells.
		</li>
		<li><b>copy first row values:</b> At least two rows are to be selected. The values of the uppermost row are
			copied downwards column by column.</li>
		<li><b>increment by 1:</b> At least two rows are to be selected. The values of the top row are incremented by 1
			column by column.</li>
		<li><b>increment by delta:</b> At least three rows are to be selected. The differences between the top row and
			the row below are determined column by column. The rows below are changed column by column with the
			calculated delta values. </li>
		<li><b>copy to clipboard:</b> The content of the selected cells is copied to the clipboard and can be used in
			other places in the table, for example. The values can also be transferred to other programs (spreadsheet).
		</li>
		<li><b>insert from clipboard:</b> The clipboard content is pasted starting at the upper left cell of the
			selected area. </li>
		<li><b>close:</b> The dialog is ended without further explanations.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>For iOS, the selection is made in the context menu with a double click. </p>

	<p>Note: A Bluetooth mouse and/or keyboard can be connected to any tablet or smartphone.</p>

	<p>To make better use of the limited screen space on smartphones and tablets, the number of rows in the tables for
		node coordinates and elements are determined by entering the number of nodes and elements. Therefore, the new
		number of elements and nodes must be entered first and then the size of the tables must be changed using the
		'resize tables' button. The process can be repeated as often as necessary.

	<P>In the ꔷꔷꔷ points menu, among other things, the unit of length can be set. The unit for the stress is adjusted:
		mm → N/mm² ; cm → kN/cm² ; m → MN/m² . The newly set unit is immediately transferred to the input page.
		Afterwards, a recalculation must still be performed so that the units of the results are adjusted.
		Furthermore, the font size and the table color can be set.
		The settings of the page can be saved as a presetting in the local memory of the used browser and are available
		again after a program restart. The presets can be deleted with the button below.
		The local storage is not a cookie. This web application performs all calculations on the local computer in the
		browser in JavaScript. No data is exchanged with a web server. Therefore, after starting the program, a network
		connection is no longer required.

	<h2 class="western" id="installation"><a href="#">Installation as an app on the desktop</a></h2>
	</p>
	<p>This application is programmed as a web application (Web App) so that it can be installed on the desktop under
		all operating systems. For this purpose, an icon is created on the desktop. This makes the app behave like an
		app installed from a store. DuennQs will still run in the installed browser, of course, but without controls
		such as the address bar. The installation process differs depending on the operating system, version, and
		browser.
		After duennQs has been started in the browser for the first time, on Android in the Chrome browser, select
		'Install App' from the application menu (three-dot menu) at the top right. A dialog appears, which must be
		confirmed. After that, the browser can be closed. There is now a new icon on the desktop called DuennQs.
	</p>
	<p>For installation on iOS, use the Safari browser. Here the command is called 'Go to Home Screen' with an add icon
	</p>

	<p>The installation on Microsoft Windows is similar to the installation on Android. In the Edge browser, the
		following section is in the application menu <i> (three-dot menu)</i>
		<img src="app-install-windows.png" name="Bild4"
			style="max-width:100%; width:423px; height:auto; border:0px; margin: auto; display: block;" />
		<!--width:423px; height:111px-->
		<br>With newer Chrome versions you may be asked directly if an installation is desired, see icon on the right
		side of the address bar :
		<img src="chrome_install.png" name="chrome_install"
			style="max-width:100%; width:436px; height:auto; border:0px; margin: auto; display: block;" />
		<!--width:436px; height:155px-->
	</p>
	<p>On macOS, the Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser is to be used for installation.</p>
	<p>The Firefox browser does not support the installation at this time. <br>
		Under the PC operating systems Microsoft Windows and Linux, you can alternatively switch to full screen mode
		with the F11 key.
	</p>
	<p>Uninstallation is done by simply deleting the icon on the desktop.</p>


	<h2 class="western" id="kompatibilitaet"><a href="#">Compatibility and problems</a></h2>

	<p>The following operating systems were tested: Windows 10↑, macOS Catalina 10.15.7↑, Ubuntu 22.04↑, Android 9-13,
		iOS 15.7.3↑. </p>
	<p>The following browsers were tested in the latest version: Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Safari, Firefox.
		Only the latest versions are tested and supported.
	</p>
	<p>Problems: On Android Firefox the selection of cells in the tables does not work.</p>

	<h2 class="western" id="tastatur"><a href="#">Virtual keyboard</a></h2>
	<p>On some Android devices, especially from Samsung, the numeric keyboard does not include a key for a negative
		sign. Unfortunately, the HTML specification leaves it up to the device manufacturer whether the numeric keyboard
		contains a key for the negative sign. Judging from the many Internet entries, the deeper meaning behind this is
		probably only clear to a few people. In these cases, it is recommended to install an additional virtual
		keyboard. For example, the original Google Android keyboard Gboard from the Play Store is an alternative. The
		keyboard still has to be activated after the installation. It is best to do this right away in the Play Store.
		Later, you can always switch between the installed keyboards (icon at the bottom right of the keyboard).
